THIS COPY IS ONLY A TEST AND ONLY FOR TESTING USES. DONT REPORT THIS REPOSITORY AND NOT USE, THANKS

Helium used to be available for both Java and Python. But I because I now only
use it from Python, I didn't have time to bring the Java implementation up to
speed as well. Similarly for Internet Explorer: Helium used to support it, but
since I have no need for it, I removed the (probably broken) old implementation.
